- DeepState: A unit test-like interface for fuzzing and symbolic execution
	- DeepState is a framework that provides C and C++ developers with a common interface to various symbolic execution and fuzzing engines. Users can write one test harness using a Google Test-like API, then execute it using multiple backends without having to learn the complexities of the underlying engines. It supports writing unit tests and API sequence tests, as well as automatic test generation.

- Orthrus
	- https://github.com/test-pipeline/orthrus
	- Orthrus is a tool for managing, conducting, and assessing dictionary-based security (fuzz) testing for autotools projects. At the moment, it supports Clang/LLVM instrumentation and the AFL ecosystem (afl-fuzz, afl-utils, afl-cov). The ultimate aim is for Orthrus to be a generic wrapper around state-of-the-art fuzz and instrumentation tools on the one hand, and disparate build systems on the other.

- RamFuzz: Combining Unit Tests, Fuzzing, and AI
	- A fuzzer for individual method parameters
	- RamFuzz is a fuzzer for individual method parameters in unit tests. A unit test can use RamFuzz to generate random parameter values for methods under test. The values are logged, and the log can be replayed to repeat the exact same test scenario. But RamFuzz also allows mutation of the replay, where some parts of the log are replayed while others are replaced by newly generated values. The new run is also logged, yielding a mutated test scenario and allowing the classic fuzzing evolution process of progressively mutating the input until a bug is triggered.
