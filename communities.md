# [C++ links](README.md): Communities

[Communities](communities.md) -- where you can discuss and share the latest C++ news, learn together, ask questions, get help.

Note: Please be mindful about the rules and focus of each of the following communities. Some are general purpose (e.g., C++ Slack Group, with a wide variety of channels), some are focused on the latest C++ news (e.g., C++ Enthusiasts, /r/cpp), whereas some are focused on asking & answering questions (e.g., /r/cpp_questions, C++ Slack Group's #learn channel, C++ Stack Overflow). If you'd like to ask a question, you're most likely to get help from a community focused on that! :-)
