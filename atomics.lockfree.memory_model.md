The Silently Shifting Semicolon (SNAPL 2015) - http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/research/snapl15.pdf  
Proposes the designation "Weak DRF0 (WDRF0)" for the C++ memory model:
"C/C++ has settled for a memory model weaker than DRF0, which we call Weak DRF0 (WDRF0). DRF programs are not guaranteed SC semantics in WDRF0. To get SC, programmers have to additionally avoid the use of the so-called low-level atomic primitives. The weak semantics of DRF programs in C++ is similar in complexity to the semantics of non-DRF programs in Java."

"The C11 and C++11 Concurrency Model" by Mark Batty  
https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/mjb211/toc.pdf  
2015 SIGPLAN John C. Reynolds Doctoral Dissertation award citation: "Mark Batty’s dissertation makes significant contributions to the understanding of memory models for C and C++. The ISO C++ committee proposed a design for C and C++ concurrency that was not up to the task of capturing a realistic relaxed-memory concurrency model. Batty’s work uncovered a number of subtle and serious flaws in the design, and produced an improved design in completely rigorous and machine-checked mathematics. Using software tools to explore the consequences of the design, derived directly from the mathematics, it showed that it has the desired behavior on many examples, and developed mechanized proofs that the design meets some of the original goals, showing that for programs in various subsets of the language one can reason in simpler models. The standards committee have adopted this work in their C11, C++11, and C++14 standards. The members of the award committee were impressed with the quality of the work, the impact it has had on the standardization process for C++, and the clarity of the presentation."

ASCYLIB  
https://github.com/LPD-EPFL/ASCYLIB  
ASCYLIB is a concurrent-search data-structure library with over 30 implementantions of linked lists, hash tables, skip lists, and binary search trees.  
ASCYLIB was developed for: Asynchronized Concurrency: The Secret to Scaling Concurrent Search Data Structures, Tudor David, Rachid Guerraoui, Vasileios Trigonakis (alphabetical order), ASPLOS '15. http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/207109/files/ascy_asplos15.pdf

CDS C++ library  
https://github.com/khizmax/libcds  
The Concurrent Data Structures (CDS) library is a collection of concurrent containers that don't require external (manual) synchronization for shared access, and safe memory reclamation (SMR) algorithms like Hazard Pointer and user-space RCU. CDS is mostly header-only template library. Only SMR core implementation is segregated to .so/.dll file.
